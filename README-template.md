## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (Vanilla)

### What I learned

I learned a lot about replacing text content and numbers in the correct format through Javascript.
I also got to experiment a bit about changing colors of SVGs.

### Continued development

I need to focus on writing more DRY JS. In additions I need to comment more in my code and also structure it better.
